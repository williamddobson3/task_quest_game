Task Quest: Game Specification Analysis
Task Quest is a pixel‑art RPG–style habit‐building game where players register and complete real‐world tasks to power up an in‐game character. The design document emphasizes a daily/weekly cycle: each day the player may add up to three tasks, complete them to raise stats and earn rewards, then use those rewards (gacha tickets) to draw collectible cards. Once a week (every Sunday), the player’s current character battles a “past self” (the character’s state from one week prior) in a turn‐based fight. This loop of Task → Growth → Battle → Gacha is the core progression cycle[1][2].
Gameplay Mechanics
Core Gameplay Loop & Daily/Weekly Cycles
Daily Cycle: Every morning (task reset), the player can enter up to 3 tasks, each with free‐form text and a chosen category (Work, Study, Life, Health, or Social)[3]. The next time they complete a real task, they tap “Complete” in the app to mark it done. Immediately, the character’s stats rise modestly and the player gains 1 gacha ticket[4]. These tasks loop daily: at midnight tasks reset and new entries start at zero[3]. Notifications (e.g. “Task Complete! Gacha＋1”) and sound effects signal rewards[5].
Weekly Cycle: Each Sunday the player can initiate a special Battle against their “past self” – a copy of their own character’s stats and equipment from 7 days earlier[6]. This is a short, turn‑based fight (maximum 5 turns) where the player chooses Attack, Magic, or Defend each turn[6][7]. Victory yields 3 gacha tickets (versus 1 ticket for a loss), plus experience; ties and defeats yield lesser rewards[8]. This weekly battle mechanic closes the loop: players’ growth (from tasks and gear) is tested against their prior self[6]. The MVP goal explicitly aims to establish this cycle of task completion → character growth → battle → card gacha[2].
Task Registration and Execution
Registration: Players add tasks via a text entry and select one of five categories (Work, Study, Life, Health, Social)[3]. At most 3 tasks can be active per day[3]. Saved tasks can be edited or deleted at any time[3]. (There is no built‑in repeat scheduling in MVP; all tasks reset each new day[9].)
Completion: When a task is done in real life, the player taps a “達成 (Complete)” button in the app. This instantly grants rewards: +1 gacha ticket (fixed) and stat increases tied to the task’s category[4]. A pop-up (“Gacha券+1”) and sound effect confirm the reward[5]. Rewards must be claimed manually. In short, every completed task immediately boosts the character and generates a gacha draw ticket[4].
Character Growth & Progression
Stats: The character has five stats – Chika (Strength, affecting physical attack), Chishi (Wisdom, affecting magic), Tai (Vitality, affecting HP), Kou (Agility, affecting turn order and ties), and Kei (Persistence, affecting task success/stability)[10]. Each task category raises two stats slightly. For example, Work tasks raise Persistence and Vitality, Study raises Wisdom and Persistence, Life raises Vitality and Strength, Health raises Strength and Agility, and Social raises Agility and Wisdom[11]. Each task completion gives a small gain (about 0.5–1.5 points) to its two stats[11][12]. The growth follows an exponential decay formula: stat gains per task are more generous at lower levels and taper off as the stat approaches its cap[12]. Gains apply immediately upon task completion[12].
Progression & Awakening: Stats start at base values determined by the character’s Job card (see below)[13]. Initially each stat’s cap is 100. When any one stat reaches 100 and at least two others are ≥80, the character “awakens” (evolves). Awakening extends the max stats to 120, adds an aura to the character sprite, and tags them with an “Awakened” badge[14]. This evolutionary boost is purely visual in MVP (no special move animations), but it represents long-term progression. In summary, growth is steady but slow, with endgame awakening requiring many tasks[12][14].
Card Collection and Effects
Card Overview: The game features ~100 cards (MVP target) divided into seven categories[15]. Rarities are N/R/SR/UR[16]. (Notably, UR “Legendary” cards are not in the normal gacha pool[17].) Each card has art, a name, and a colored frame indicating rarity. Players can hold up to 3 copies of a given card[16]; any 4th copy automatically converts to experience points. The complete collection is viewable in a card encyclopedia (see below).
Acquisition & Slots: Most cards are obtained via gacha tickets or special rewards. Cards fall into equipable categories. The character has equipment slots: 1 Job slot, 1 Weapon slot, and 3 Misc slots (magic/support/legendary)[18]. Job cards (one per character) define the character’s base stats (e.g. a “Scholar” job might start with high Wisdom and Persistence)[13]. Weapon cards boost physical attacks, Magic cards boost spells, Support cards provide flat stat buffs (e.g. “+1 Persistence”), and Legendary cards (rare UR) give large stat boosts when equipped[19]. Some cards like “Destiny” or “Memory” have special effects or are rewards for milestones[15][19].
Card Effects: When equipped, cards augment the character’s combat stats. For example, a Weapon card might add +6 Attack, a Magic card +6 Magic, or a Support card +1 to a stat[19]. Equipped cards are automatically factored into combat calculations (see Battle System). The character can swap gear at any time from the Status screen (see UI below). In summary, gacha cards function as equipment that shape the character’s stats and combat power[18][19].
Battle System & Mechanics (Weekly “Past Self” Battles)
Battle Overview: Sundays unlock a special battle feature. Tapping the Battle icon allows a turn-based duel against the player’s own character as it was one week ago[6]. The outcome is determined by current stats and equipped cards vs. the saved stats/cards. A short scripted dialogue introduces the fight (with lines like “Try beating your past self!”).
Combat Mechanics: Battles are command-driven: each turn the player chooses Attack, Magic, or Defend[6][7]. Up to 5 turns are played. Turn order is decided by the Agility (Kou) stat (higher Kou goes first; ties favor the player)[7]. On each turn:
Attack deals physical damage: Damage = 1.2×(Chika) + 2.0×(Weapon Attack).
Magic deals magic damage: Damage = 1.2×(Chishi) + 2.0×(Magic Power)[20].
Defend halves incoming damage and applies a 1.2× attack buff for the next turn[20][21].
(If the opponent is defending, incoming attack or magic damage is also halved.)
The character’s Vitality (Tai) sets HP = 10×Tai[22]. The Persistence (Keizoku) stat adds stability: it slightly reduces randomness in damage (±10% variance is shrunk with higher Persistence)[20][21].
Enemy AI: The “past self” uses a simple AI. It selects Attack, Magic, or Defend based on the battle state (e.g. it favors defense or magic if its HP is low)[23]. In the MVP it is intentionally basic.
Outcome & Rewards: After 5 turns (or if one side is KO’d), the fighter with more HP remaining wins; if tied, higher Agility wins[8]. Victory grants the player 3 gacha tickets and experience; defeat still grants 1 ticket and XP[8]. Upon battle end, a result screen shows “You have surpassed your past self!” (win) or a motivating message on loss, plus the ticket reward. Simple animations play: a slash or magic effect and SE for attacks, shield for defense[24]. No battle history is kept beyond awarding rewards. In short, this system tests the player’s progress each week and provides a fun PvE “boss” fight against their own record[6][8].
Clan System & Cooperative Gameplay
Clan Basics: Players can form or join clans (small guilds) to collaborate. Anyone can create a clan (one clan per creator) and clans hold up to 5 members[25]. Joining can be approval-based (leader approves) or open[26]. Members may leave or be kicked freely at any time[25]. There is no in-game chat; players are encouraged to coordinate via Discord or external chat[25]. Clans have metadata like a name, category (e.g. “Study-Focused”, “Fitness-Focused”, etc. – six predefined types[27]), an optional description, and a member list. Clan UIs include a Clan List (showing name, category, description, member count, activity mode, with buttons to join or apply[28]) and a Clan Detail page (showing clan info and buttons to join/leave or kick/disband if you’re the leader[29]).
Clan Tasks & Rewards: The main cooperative element is a weekly clan task goal. Each member’s completed tasks count toward the clan total for that week. The target is 15 tasks per member (e.g. 5 members → 75 tasks)[30]. A progress indicator (e.g. “45/75”) updates in the clan UI[30]. At Sunday 23:59 the system checks if the goal was met. If so, every clan member receives 5 gacha tickets[30]; if not, no reward. Additionally, clan membership affects login bonuses: when in a clan, players get 2 “Destiny” cards (運命カード) per login instead of 1[31]. In summary, clans incentivize teamwork by pooling task efforts weekly for shared ticket rewards[30].
User Actions
Daily & Weekly Player Interactions
Daily Tasks: Each day the player will typically log in, see an empty task list, and enter up to three tasks in their categories[3]. Throughout the day they complete these real-life tasks and press the “Complete” button in the app. This triggers stat increases and notifies “Gacha Ticket +1!”[5].
Gacha & Card Management: With tickets accumulated from tasks, daily login, or battles, the player can tap the Gacha icon to draw new cards. Duplicate cards (beyond 3 copies) turn into experience points automatically[16]. Players review new cards in the Card Encyclopedia or equip them via the Character/Status screen.
Equipment: The player may visit the Character (Status) page to equip or swap cards. On this screen (backdrop: a study room), the character’s portrait is shown on the left and equipment slots (1 Job, 1 Weapon, 3 Magic/Support) appear below[32]. Tapping a card in the slot opens a pop‐up with “Equip”/“Unequip” options[32].
Battle: Each Sunday, the player is prompted (nav icon enabled) to initiate the Battle. After fighting, rewards (tickets/XP) and a message display. This is an expected weekly action.
Clan Participation: If the player is in a clan, they will see the clan progress bar. They should try to complete enough tasks each week to help reach the target. Clan events (success or failure) generate notifications on Sunday (see below).
Login Bonus: The game also features daily login bonuses with light UI. For example, each day shows a lottery-style draw; the contents vary by day of week and clan status[33][31]. These bonuses often include “Destiny” cards or gacha tickets.
UI Interactions & Progression Pathways
Main Navigation: The UI is organized with a persistent bottom nav bar (icons for Home/Tasks, Character/Status, Battle, Gacha, and Clan)[34]. This lets the player switch between entering tasks, managing the character, performing battles, doing gacha, and accessing clans. The home/tasks screen shows the list of 3 tasks, an “Add Task” form, and the Complete buttons. The status screen shows the character sprite (with any aura if awakened), equipped card slots, and a pentagon radar chart of the five stats[32]. The battle screen shows the two characters, HP bars, action log, and command buttons[7][35].
Progression UI: As the player fills tasks, stat numbers on the radar chart grow. Collecting cards fills the card encyclopedia (図鑑) with colorful icons. When cards are collected or opened, popups display their details and allow equipping. On awakening, the character image and aura update (the chart’s max scale also increases from 100 to 120)[12][32]. The design is consistently “cute pixel” style[2]. All progression (gaining stats, unlocking cards, leveling) is immediately reflected in the UI.
Tutorial & Onboarding: On first launch, the player creates a username (up to 8 characters; required)[36]. Immediately after, an unskippable tutorial begins. It uses speech-bubble overlays (17 screens total) to explain task entry, completion, gacha draws, equipping cards, battles, and clan functions in sequence[37]. This ensures the player quickly learns the main loops. After completing the tutorial, the player begins normal play with all features introduced.
Technical System Requirements
Platforms & Devices: Task Quest is built as a web application (MVP). It supports mobile and PC browsers with a responsive layout[38]. The front-end is standard web tech: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React is permitted)[38]. Because it’s browser-based, it can run on smartphones and desktops without native apps.
Data Storage & Accounts: The MVP uses guest/local storage only. No user registration or server login is needed[38][39]. All game data (tasks, stats, cards, progress) are stored on the device (e.g. in browser localStorage). Thus, uninstalling or switching devices will lose progress[39]. On first play, the game generates an ID and stores the username locally[36]. (Server‐backed accounts or cloud save are not in MVP.)
Sound & Media: Audio is lightweight. Background music and sound effects are in common formats (MP3/WAV)[40]. The focus is on short SE clips (attacks, notifications) rather than lengthy audio. A settings screen lets the user toggle BGM and SE on/off[41].
Expandability & Future Integrations: The document notes that future versions may add account linking, such as Google or Discord authentication[42], to allow cross-device save or social features. However, in MVP these are omitted to reduce complexity[43]. Clans currently rely on external coordination (no built‐in chat) and Discord is suggested for communication[25][43]. The architecture is intended to be extensible (e.g. one day adding Facebook login or push notifications), but the initial release is deliberately minimal.
Other Key Features
Gacha System & Monetization: In addition to free tickets from tasks/battles, there is an optional paid gacha. A button on the UI allows a 100‑yen daily gacha draw (one pull)[44]. The purchase prompts a confirmation (“Are you sure?”) and shows success/failure feedback. This is the primary monetization (consumable gacha draws). Daily login bonuses (Monday–Saturday, Sunday, and clan status variants) provide additional tickets or “Destiny” cards for free[45][31]. Thus, players can grind normally or pay for an extra pull each day. All gacha content, rewards, and rarities are pre-set in the design.
Card Encyclopedia (図鑑): The character/status screen scrolls vertically to reveal a Card Encyclopedia panel[46]. It shows all 100 cards in a grid (5 per row). Cards the player owns appear in full color (framed by N/R/SR/UR borders); missing cards are greyed out with a “?” icon[46][47]. Tapping any card pops up its details: name, art, rarity, description, compatible jobs, and buttons to equip/unequip[48]. At the bottom of the encyclopedia is a counter (“Owned 45/100”) and filters by category or rarity[49]. This lets players track their collection and read card lore or strategies.
Status UI & Design: The Status screen centers on a pentagonal radar chart plotting the five stats (Chika, Chishi, Tai, Kou, Kei)[32]. Each stat’s label (two Japanese characters) and numeric value are displayed at a vertex. The chart scales to 100 (normal) or 120 (post-awakening)[50]. The character sprite stands left of the chart; after evolution it gains a colored aura and an “Awakened” badge[51]. Equipment slots are shown below (with card icons), and tapping them brings equip pop-ups. The background is illustrated as a cozy study (書斎) scene, reinforcing the habit-building theme[32]. Overall, the UI is cohesive and “cute pixel” styled as envisioned for the MVP[2][32].
Notifications & Audio UI: Task Quest uses lightweight notifications for feedback. Completing a task might trigger a toast saying “◯◯ completed! Gacha×1”[52]. Clan events show “Clan Task Achieved! Gacha×5”[53]. Rewards from battles similarly pop up. All such messages come with a simple SE (sound effect)[40]. In battles, dialogs appear in speech bubbles with short animations (a slashing blade for attack, a magical glow for spells) and matching sounds[24]. The settings screen (MVP scope) allows toggling sound and resetting data[41]. Connectivity issues or other alerts use simple placeholder screens. In summary, the audio/notification design is kept minimal to avoid clutter, matching the overall friendly aesthetic[24][40].
